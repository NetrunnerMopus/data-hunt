# Development

* Use Unity 2018.1.7f1.
* Follow the MVC architecture to decouple the raw model from inputs (controller) and outputs (view) layers.
* Run tests to quickly check if things are working.
* Some assets cannot be distributed via this repo due to unfriendly licensing.
  You either have to accept the project is broken or buy your own assets and put them in the `Assets/Nonredist` 
  directory. At least you can contribute to the model layer and use tests as a feedback loop.
