# Playtesting

Playtesting is a great way to guide the project in the right direction.
By playing the game, you can help:
* generate [new ideas](ISSUES.md)
* hunt down [bugs](ISSUES.md)
* find [bad design](ISSUES.md)
* validate good design

## How to play it?

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/dagguh/netrunner/releases), find the latest release, expand the assets list:
